   <p>In Baloch culture, generally parents and elders arrange the marriage after seeking consent from both parties. When a young man comes to his age, his family decides a suitable match for him. Sometimes, the young man himself chooses a girl and requests his family to ask for the girl’s hand from her family. However, many a times, the marriages are also arranged within relatives and friends.</p>

   <p><strong>Wedding Day Rituals:</strong>
Nikah: The Islamic marriage ceremony where the marriage contract is signed in the presence of witnesses, typically led by a religious authority. This is a significant moment that formally binds the couple.
Rukhsati: The emotional farewell of the bride from her parental home, which symbolizes her transition into her husband’s family. This moment is often marked by tears and blessings from family members.
Walima: This is a grand reception hosted by the groom's family after the wedding. It often includes a feast, symbolizing community and family gathering to celebrate the couple's new life together.</p>
