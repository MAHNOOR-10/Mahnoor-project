    <h1>Traditional Unveiled</h1>
    <h2>Traditional Games</h2>
    <h3>punjab</h3>
    <img src="images/punjab games1.jpeg">
    <p>Punjab, a land rich in culture and tradition, boasts a vibrant tapestry of indigenous games that reflect its heritage and communal spirit. From the fierce energy of Kabaddi, where players rely on strength and agility to tag opponents, to the rhythmic skill of Gilli Danda, a game that tests precision and hand-eye coordination, every game carries a story of resilience and camaraderie. In bustling villages, children race against time in Pithoo Garam, stacking stones while dodging incoming throws, while elders engage in Kikli, a joyful spinning dance that binds friendships tighter with every twirl. These traditional games, untouched by modern technology, continue to weave the essence of Punjab's soul—where laughter, competition, and sheer enthusiasm breathe life into open fields and dusty playgrounds.</p>
